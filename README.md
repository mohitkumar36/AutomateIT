# Automate_Insta
Automating Instagram texts.

This Python program send a single message to any number of people you want by using your credentials and usernames of the people you want to send the text. This works with the latest version of Instagram Desktop (Date : 23/03/2022).

This Python script uses **Selenium** and **webdriver-manager**.

>**Selenium**: It is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others. I personally prefer Python as itâ€™s very easy to write code in python. A browser-driver then executes these scripts on a browser-instance on your device. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
```
pip install selenium
```
>**webdriver-manager**: It provides a way to automatically manage drivers for different browsers. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
```
pip install webdriver-manager
```
